NAME
    CHANGES - Revision history for Text::Similarity

DESCRIPTION
    0.05
    Released April 4, 2008 (all changes by TDP)

    *   Made it possible for users to input strings directly via
        text_compare.pl and getSimilarityStrings. Previously it was only
        possible to directly measure the similarity of files, but now
        strings can be measured.

    0.04
    Released March 21, 2008 (all changes by TDP)

    *   Introduced tests for text_compare.pl (t/text_compare.t) - added
        support for os neutral file reads via FILE::SPEC in this and other
        .t files.

    *   Introduced tests for getOverlaps (t/overlaps.t)

    *   Improved synopsis examples to show how to pass options via arguments
        in hashes

    *   Clarified that stemming and compounding are not currently supported
        disabled compfile option in text_compare.pl

    *   Made file handling in text_compare more robust so that when a file
        does not exist an error message is given and failure is immediate

    *   Changed method of passing constants in test cases from (eg.)
        "Text::Similarity::NORMALIZE" to "normalize" in order to support
        backwards compatability with perl 5.6.

    *   Introduce normalize and no-normalize tests for getSimilarity

    *   Fix Similarity.pm Synopsis example not to use files in /t that are
        no longer available
